Please, before this article, read [about linters in this collection](/docs/linters/readme.md).

## What is included in standards?
### `Silver` standard
[See the configuration file for this standard](/linters/silver/.stylintrc):

## How to use?
### How to install the presents?

**1. Add via yarn package manager**

```bash
yarn add lovely-code
```

### How to use default configuration?

**1. Define `scripts` command in your package.json**

The following command will use custom configuration file and check only files with extension `.styl` only in folder `./core`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint:stylus": "stylint --config ./node_modules/lovely-code/linters/silver/.stylintrc ./core"
  }
}
```

**2. Run the command**

```bash
yarn lint:stylus 
```

### How to extend from default configuration?

Unfortunately, there is no ability to extend the configuration.
You can use one of three modes (`bronze`, `silver` or `gold`) or copy-and-paste and override rules.
