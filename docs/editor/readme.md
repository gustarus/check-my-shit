# Configuration files for your ide

## Why it is extremely useful?
You can use in a combination with code auto-reformating in your ide product (for example, see [docs for idea products](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/reformatting-source-code.html)).
It helps to automatically support many code-quality rules.

## Use `.editorconfig` to support basic code style rules
[See current version of the `.editorconfig` in this collection](/editor/.editorconfig).

It helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.
The `EditorConfig` project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.
`EditorConfig` (`.editorconfig`) files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.
